Reactor by Assaf Shmaryahu and Lior Jerbi

    first extract the zip file.
    after that you open the terminal on the location of the file you extract.
    then write on the terminal "make" it will compile all the file.
    the you write "./react_server".
    after that to open the client side you need to open another terminal and write "telnet localhost 9034",
    this will open the client chat, the client can send as many messages you want and you will see it on server terminal,you can open as many client you want,
    (every client in different terminal). 
    
    have fun!
